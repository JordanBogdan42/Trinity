Roger Orr

Roger has contributed to SOCI the following fixes and patches::
- the patch for a memory leak that was present in the code
  reading into the Row objects.
- patches and fixes that allowed the very early version of the 2.0.0 release
  to compile on g++ 4.0.1.
- patch that solves incompletely specified behaviour that caused problems with
  various compilers when exception was thrown from the statement's destructor.

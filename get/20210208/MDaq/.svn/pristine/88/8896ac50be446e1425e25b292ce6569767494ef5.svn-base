 *  The behavior of this call depends on the state of the semaphore counter
 *  before the call:
 *  - The counter's value is 0: if there are one or more threads that are
 *    blocked by a take() call on this semaphore, one thread is
 *    unblocked. Which thread is unblocked depends on the ordering option
 *    of blocked threads: if isPriorityOrder is set, the thread with
 *    highest priority is unblocked, otherwise it is the thread that has
 *    blocked the earliest.
 *    If there are no blocking threads, the counter is incremented to 1.
 *  - The counter's value is greater than 0 but smaller than its maximum
 *    value(maxCount): the counter is incremented by 1.
 *  - The counter has already reached its maximum value(maxCount):
 *    nothing happens.
 *  -# The semaphore is a mutex(MutexSema):
 *  - If the calling thread has not called take() on this semaphore before,
 *    the give() call is invalid.
 *  - Otherwise, the give() call pops the latest take() call. One thread
 *    may lock a mutex many times but it has to make as many give() calls
 *    to unlock the mutex.

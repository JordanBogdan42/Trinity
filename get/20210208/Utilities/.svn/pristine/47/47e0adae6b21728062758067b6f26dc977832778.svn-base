 * number of parameters, the create() method will be generated with the same

 *
 * Compared to other possible implementations:
 *  - unlike traditional GOF pattern it doesn't require you to define classes
 *    for abstract and concrete factories: a method is enough (and with
 *    boost::factory nothing is needed)
 *  - unlike function pointer solution it allows you to use any kind of callable:
 *    free standing function, method, functor, using argument binding if necessary (boost::bind)
 *  - unlike using boost::function directly, it handles ownership and smart-pointers
 *    upcasts without problem, and have an interface that makes explicit the

/**
 * This class enables in-place parsing of data, which means decoding some data
 * in a buffer and binding POD data on it, so that no copy of the data is necessary.
 * Binding is achieved through ValueRef and ArrayRef classes.
 *
 * For more complex data layout, where variable-length or optional data are
 * contained into arrays, direct binding with a predefined number of ValueRef and
 * ArrayRef might not be possible: defining vectors of them is necessary.
 *
 * In order to enable parsing of user-defined binding fields (structures made of
 * several Value/ArrayRef, the parse_1(BindingField&) method is here to be specialized.
 * The specializations must reside inside a utl::io namespace block.
 *
 * Parsing a DataField can be either unchecked or checked (the data is examined to
 * determine if it matches the DataField). for a DataField to be checked a
 * bool isDataField(const InplaceParser&, const DataField*) must exist in the utl::io
 * namespace. A user-defined overload can be defined for any type (or group of
 * type, if using a template method and SFINAE). It has to be declared prior to
 * including InplaceParser.ipp.

2015-11-17  psizun
	* Modified handling of CoBo boards present in topology but with parameter "isActive" set to false in configuration files: their AMC slot s no longer searched for and, more importantly, they are excluded from
 	the alignment procedure (during which their Mutant link mode is set to Disconnected);
 	consequently they should not appear in the Mutant CLOCK_TREE_CONFIG1/2 registers which is used to set the Mutant SHELF_MASK register

2015-10-19  psizun
	* Added to ECC state machine the readout of !AsAd Tint and Text temperatures before the end of each run.

	* Added mutant-bram-check command to command line client to test 16-bit words of the MutantB BRAM.

2015-05-20  psizun
	* Added consistency check for 'suppressMultiplicity' configuration parameter: now rejecting configurations where
	 suppression is enabled for an AGET position of an AsAd board but disabled for the same (active) AGET position
	  of another AsAd board connected to the same CoBo board.
	* Added consistency check for 'isAllChannelRead' configuration parameter: now rejecting configurations where
	 not all AGET chips on a CoBo board are in the same readout mode.

2015-04-30  psizun (on behalf of gwittwer)
	* The Mutant register MASTER_MASK has been renamed into SHELF_MASK.

2014-10-13  psizun (on behalf of braine)
	* Setting CoBo's 'mutantConfig' bit before configuring the CoBo boards causes errors during the initialization of AsAd boards.
	* On G.W.'s request, CoBo boards should temporarily be stopped before Mutant boards at least until upgrade of Mutant firmware.  
	* Disabled check of the ready bits of Mutant slaves.
	* Enabling/disabling Mutant module during start/stop.
	* Uncommenting MutantNode::runInit seems to cause problems. 

2014-10-01  psizun
	* Added parameter Node[*].instance[*].isActive in 'describe' file so that users do not have to completely remove an instance to disable its use.
	* Finished removing need for a 'prepare' file: the same 'configure' file is used for boath 'prepare' and 'configure' transitions.

2014-09-30  psizun
	* Improved resiliency of ECC to reboot of CoBo board.

2014-09-29  psizun
	* Added new sampling frequencies: in addition to the frequencies 100 MHz/2**N already allowed for both R-CoBo and M-CoBo,
	frequencies 2000 MHz/N are now allowed on M-CoBo specifically (answers request from J-PARC for 40 MHz frequency).

	* Optimized log messages from state machine to run control; refs #34, #50, #88.

2014-06-04  psizun
	* Made the alignment procedure the very first step of the prepare transition; otherwise it messes the configuration of the CoBo boards; refs #78.
	* Switched to the non-verbose mode of the Mutant alignment procedure.
	* Disabled all configuration code related to Mutant B until new
	* Linux image is available with proper memory addresses.
	* Updated documentation; refs #56.

2014-05-23  psizun
	* Added power off of all AsAd boards upon returning to the IDLE state; refs #50, #88.
	* Now configuring GPIO_SW_LEDS device directions before checking power supply of Mutant A module; refs #50, #78.
	* Re-disabled all CoBo PLL code on ML507 (had been enabled for debugging the new PLL related parameters); refs #88.
	* Added state machine parameter to set the `zeroSuppressInvert` bit; refs #50, #88.

	* Updated documentation; refs  #56.

2014-05-21  psizun
	* FIXed inversion of CoBo LEDs in ECC: the LED to switch on when AsAd is connected and powered is P (like Plugged), not D (like Downlink); refs #50, #88, #90.
	* Added description of "zeroSuppressInvert" bit of CoBo pipeCtrl register; refs #45.
	* Fixed some clang warnings; refs #84.

2014-05-20  psizun

2014-05-15  psizun
	* Added XML description of the new CoBo registers "lemoMux" and "pllStatus"; refs #45.
	* Modified documentation to point to newly released CoBo data format specification; refs #56.

2014-05-14  psizun
	* Reverted to old configuration of CoBo PLL device (to be used with Mutant GMC, not CoBo standalone); refs #88.

	* Modified handling of invalid write pointer values (no need to copy these invalid write values, it can lead to an endless loop sending data); refs #70.

2014-05-13  psizun
	* Renamed new data format description files for clarity; refs #56.

2014-05-12  psizun

	* The configuration used for the CoBo PLL device now depends (when its is not skipped altogether) on the value of the CoBo 'firmwareDate' register; refs #79, #88.

2014-04-30  psizun
	* Updated description of Mutant registers.

2014-04-25  psizun
	* Modified configuration of the CoBo PLL device: it now depends on the value of the CoBo 'firmwareDate' register.
	* Implemented changes in RCC-ECC SOAP interface made according to AGATA's needs (all transitions now have the same signature); see email from F. Saillant.

2014-04-24  psizun
	* Renamed new parameter 'pllConfigEnabled' into 'skipPLLConfig'; refs #50, #79, #56.

2014-04-22  psizun

	  configuration of the CoBo PLL device for debugging.
	  Modified configuration of the coBo PLL device according to emails
	  from F. A.-N. on April 18th to be able to make new firmware work
	  without a Mutant module:
	  R11/MODE = 6 instead of 0, R11/SYNC_POL_INV=1 instead of 0,
	  R13/Status_CLKin0_MUX = 1 instead of 0.
	  refs #79, #88

2014-04-17  psizun
	* First test at handling CoBo LED's from the ECC stae machine and from the CoBo software:
	  - all LEDs are switched off at the beginning of the configuration;
	  - if an AsAd board is detected, power supplied and powered on, the 'D' green LED is switched on;
	  - if an AsAd board to be used is not connected or not power supplied, the 'B' red LED is pulsing slowly;
	  - the embedded thread checking every 30s the status of the AsAd
		board now makes the 'B' red LED of the boards in auto-protection mode pulse fast.
	  refs #50, #70, #90

2014-04-15  psizun
	* Decreased verbosity of AsAd pulser reset; refs #70.
	* Added FAQ entry on external triggering mode of the AsAd pulser; refs #56.

	  the AsAd voltage generator in its external triggering mode, to get it ready for the next external signal; refs #70, #85, #50.

2014-04-04  psizun
	* Fixed data router issue: when establishing a new connection, the data receiver must reset the data processor to avoid leftovers
	  from the previous connection (data reconstruction should not resume where it had been stopped but start over); refs #71.
	* Added protection against duplicate start of the system; refs #88.
	* Updated documentation (Mageia, CoBo circular buffers); refs #56.
	* Improved handling of error when provided with an invalid data router port number (greater than 65535); refs #50.

2014-04-03  psizun
	* - DAQ statistics are now printed even when no new data have been
	  sent, if the interrupt counter has been incremented.
	  - DAQ statistics are updated before flushing the data and not
	  afterwards to have a better view of the occupancy of the circular
	  buffers.
	  - When looping over the 4 circular buffers, errors are now
	  handled outside the loop, since there is no point in emptying a
	  buffer if we are not sure we sent an integer number of frames
	  from the previous buffer.
	  - The FrameStorage mode of the dataRouter now logs the fact that
	  it _started_ rebuilding a frame to avoid giving the idea that it
	  is idle when waiting for 15 GB of data that will never come.
	  refs #70, #71

2014-03-31  psizun
	* Fixed typo; refs #84.
	* Added interface for disconnecting data sender from its data router; refs #50, #88.
	* AsAd TCM device (refs #70, #85, #50, #56); see GET-AS-002-0005:
	  - added parameter externalTriggerMode to trigger the AsAd
	  generator by an external signal on the ISP1 input rather than by slow control.
	  - added parameter defaulVoltage to customize generator default
	  output voltage rather than using 1 V; this allows use of full +/-
	  2 V of the generator instead of just +/- 1 V.
	  - added parameter triggerDelay to set the output step triggering delay.

2014-03-20  psizun
	* Fixed values proposed for AsAd external capacitance (bit RNG of AsAd register TCM0) to 1 pF and 11 pF; refs #50, #56, #85.

2014-03-12 13:24  psizun
	* Added property --Ice.IPv6=0 to communicator of getEccServer,
	  dataRouter, getEccSoapServer and GetController to disable Ice
	  support for IPv6; refs #88.
	  By default, IPv6 support is enabled in Ice 3.5. On a host without
	  IPv6 stack (like sedipcc212?), the use of the wildcard address
	  when starting a server on all interfaces causes an Ice::SocketException: Address family not supported by protocol.
	  See:
	  - http://www.zeroc.com/forums/help-center/6184-address-family-not-supported-protocol.html

2014-03-06 16:25  psizun
	* Changed data transfer algorithm to avoid desynchronisation
	  between AsAd buffers: each step (write pointer update, data
	  transfer, read pointer update) is applied to all buffers in
	  batch; TO BE TESTED; refs #70.

2014-03-05 15:41  psizun
	* Updated code for configuration of AsAd LCM2 documentation to
	  stick more closely to GET-AS-002-0006 and GET-As-002-0010; refs

2014-02-21 15:54  psizun
	* Adapted ECC soap sever and client to gSOAP 2.8.17 (installed by
	  Homebrew on OS X); refs #34, #84.

2014-02-21 14:48  psizun
	* Fixed last reference to get::daq::FdtDataSender (moved to the mdaq::daq namespace); refs #70.

2014-02-21 14:41  psizun
	* Fixed bug in configure.ac (missing square bracket); refs #84.

	  Updated script to download software.

2014-02-07  psizun
	* Fixed failure to build getEccSoapServer on Mac OS X: the file
	  system being case-insensitive, the object file from the
	  eccServer.cpp (built) source file was overwriting the object file
	  from the EccServer.cpp source file, leading to unreferenced
	  symbols when linking; refs #34, #63, #84.

2014-02-06  psizun
	* Updated Ice M4 macro in GetBench so that path to Ice does not
	  have to be provided on Mac OS X; refs #84.
	  Improved installation scripts, added CeCILL license.
	* Improved installation script; refs #84.

2014-02-05  psizun
	* Switched to Boost random number generators (there still seems to
	  be a bias: the mean period of the sample is smaller than the
	  parameter of the distribution); refs #16.
	  fixed installation scripts, added choice of log level; refs #84.

2014-02-04  psizun
	* Changed default IP address of getEccServer from INADDR_NONE to
	  INADDR_ANY (behavior is the same as both addresses leads to an
	  Ice proxy listening to all interfaces) and default addresses of
	  dataRouter from 127.0.01 to INADDR_ANY; refs #88.
	* Ensuring backward compatibility of new ECC versions with old
	  embedded server where new random pulser is not available; refs
	  #88.

2014-02-03  psizun

	* Added pseudo-random Poisson mode to the AsAd pulser manager; refs

	  Updated documentation; refs #56.

2014-01-29  psizun

	* Moved subscription to alarm notifications to immediately after
	  activation of AsAd monitoring to ease detection of AsAd alarms
	  occurring during the configuration; refs #50.
	  Added to doc the instructions for installing get-config-wizard;
	  refs #56.

2014-01-21  psizun
	* Restored old ECC operation asadInjectCharge (with deprecated
	  slice directive) for the sake of the old AGET test bench
	  versions; refs #88.
	* 
	  - Added double pulse feature to AsAd periodic pulser (for 2p
	  mode); refs #50, #70.
	  - Added check of compatibility between readout depth and 2p mode
	  parameters.
	  - Updated documentation (new parameters
	  CoBo.Generator.doublePulseEnabled and
	  CoBo.Generator.secondPulseAmplitude); refs #56.
	* Slightly improved periodicity of periodic tasks; refs #70.

2014-01-20  psizun
	* Fixed incompatibility with older firmware versions where the
	  'hardwareVersion' register did not exist and is found to have a
	  value of 0xffffffff; refs #88.
	  Interpreting this value as aM-CoBo value leads to assuming the
	  existence of the PLL device which leads to the crash of VxWorks
	  image.
	  Updated documentation; refs #56.
	* Modified AsAd alarm watcher so that it checks not only the
	  asadStatus register but also the asadEnable register since, on
	  M-CoBo, the alarm bit is set for disconnected AsAd boards; refs
	  #70.
	* Incremented GetBench library version-info; refs #84.

2014-01-17  psizun
	* Created parameters for configuring the alarm notification service
	  in the ECC state machine, updated documentation; refs #50, #56,

2014-01-14  psizun
	* Modified values returned for field 'Transition' (now one value
	  per transition instead of simply 0 or 1); refs #34, #50.

2014-01-13  psizun
	* Modified ECC/RCC state machine (added field 'Transition' to state
	  returned by getState method) so that the interface is identical

	  Rewrote SOAP ECC server to remain responsive while handling long
	  transitions; refs #50.

2014-01-10  psizun
	* Added periodic task to check AsAd alarm bits every 30 seconds.
	  For now, it is only started by the 'asad-alarm-monitor' command
	  of the ECC command line client.
	  If there is an alarm, its is simply logged in the VxWorks
	  console; in the future, it will have to be relayed to the ECC
	  server and then to the GANIL Run Control Alarm service (see
	  https://dsm-trac.cea.fr/get/raw-attachment/wiki/GanilSpiral2DAQDocumentation/ICC_DAQ_Logging%26Alarms_1.0.pdf).
	  refs #70, #87

2014-01-08  psizun
	* All the AsAd DAC registers are now systematically initialized,
	  instead of relying on their supposed power-on default value; refs
	  #50, #86.
	  Indeed, it was observed that the DAC1 register sometimes had the
	  value 0x8 instead of 0, leading to some weird data.
	  
	  Added description of all the DAC registers; refs #45.
	  
	  Fixed bug in state machine causing runs to be started on CoBo
	  boards described but not activated.

2014-01-07  psizun
	* Added to state machine configuration parameters
	  'AsAd.Generator.periodicModeEnabled' and

	  Fixed documentation; refs #56.

2013-12-20  anvar

	  100 MHz CKW frequencies
	  refs #79
	* Removed possibility to select a CKR frequency other than 25 MHz; refs #62.
	* Fixed bug in parsing of argument of 'pll-write' command; refs #79

2013-12-02  psizun
	* Added to state machine the readout of the AsAd board identifier;

	  registers in the right order; refs #50, #83.
	* Updated and completed description of AsAd Identity Manager
	  registers; refs #45.
	  Added SO_REUSEADDR socket option to GANIL SAOP ECC server; refs

	  Added handler for SIGINT signal in getEccSoapServer so that, when
	  killed with Ctrl-C, it shuts down properly and frees its port
	  immediately; refs #34.
	  Updated log4j properties so that ECC log messages are displayed
	  by RCC GUI.
	  Updated documentation; refs #56.

2013-11-26  psizun
	* Added to ECC state machine the configuration of the CoBo
	  'readOffset' register; refs #50.
	* Adding to ECC state machine the new configuration parameters

2013-11-22  anvar
	* Cosmetics refs #61

2013-11-22  fchateau
	* dropped usage of AX_FLAG_REINITIALIZATION: flags more specific
	  than -Wall and -Werror should be specified during configure
	  because there are too many compatibility issues with them.
	  Removed -Wno-portability-recursive: new versions of ice.am,
	  ax_lib_ice.m4, autotroll.am, autotroll.m4 should address these
	  problems, refs #52.

2013-11-22  psizun
	* FIXed test/main.cpp to adapt to new boost paradigm; refs #17.

2013-11-12  psizun
	* Added invocation of PLL configuration method for targets for
	  which the 'hardwareVersion' register exists and has a value equal
	  to or greater than 2; refs #16, #50.
	* Added to ECC state machine the use of the new 'calibrationAget'
	  CoBo register; setting this register to a value different from 0
	  does allow to pass the AGET calibration sequence even though AGET
	  no. 0 is disabled but it seems to have adverse consequences on
	  the AGET chip configuration later on (the register values read
	  completely differ from the values written); refs #50.
	* Added to ECC state machine the readout of the new CoBo registers
	  'firmwareRelease', 'firmwareDate' and 'hardwareVersion'; refs #50.
	  See https://project-get.cea.fr/Groups/100_todolist/400_wp4_data_acquisi/reduced_cobo_4_aget1226/view

2013-11-06  psizun
	* It seems that, with Ice 3.5.1, the out parameter of an ICE method
	  should not be named 'response' as it hides the 'response' data
	  member of type Response defined in the callback in the generated
	  code; refs #17, #53.

	* Added check of initial monitoring alert status of connected and
	  active AsAd board(s); refs #50.

2013-10-22  psizun
	* No longer loading MFM data formats from the FrameStorgae
	  constructor so that GetController will not have to be started
	  from a directory containing these formats.
	  This is however still a requirement for dataRouter as I do not
	  want the GetBench package to depend on the Qt library (for
	  QCoreApplication::applicationDirPath).
	  refs #61.
	* Recoded configuration of AsAd monitoring device (now conform to
	  GET-AS-002-0004 and fully configurable); refs #50.

	  it done by the firmware?) at the run start; refs #50.

2013-08-26  psizun
	* Fixed bug in configuration of the AsAd generator; any use of the
	  writeField method on an AsAd register field requires to have

2013-08-21  psizun
	* - Modified dataRouter FrameStorage so that frames from different
	  AsAd boards are stored in different files; refs #71. Since
	  dataRouter creates a new file each time the event ID of a new
	  frame gets smaller than the ID of the previous frame,
	  it led, when working with several AsAd boards, to new files being
	  created every event.
	  - dataRouter still does not look at the CoBo ID: when working
	  with several CoBo boards, each dataRouter instance should be
	  started in a different directory to avoid conflicts between file
	  streams.
	  - GetController still saves all data in a single file without
	  looking at the AsAd ID.
	  - Updated HTML doc; refs #56.

2013-08-09  psizun
	* Adapted DAQ classes to the readout of 4 AsAd boards; refs #61.

2013-08-08  psizun

2013-06-14  psizun
	* Restored alias "intEnable_asad0" for bit "intEnable" to keep old
	  software working with new hardware description file; refs #61.
	* - Modified description of "pipeCtrtl" register (see email from N.
	  Usher):
	  - Removed bits 31:29, since we are doing one CPU interrupt per
	  CoBo instead of one per AsAd.
	  - Added a new bit 8 "adcDeskew" to initiate CoBo deserializer
	  deskew sequence.
	  - Adapted state machine code o the removal of bits 31:29.
